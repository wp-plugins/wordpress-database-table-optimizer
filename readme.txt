The WordPress Database Table Optimizer plugin will automatically make sure that your WordPress MySQL database tables are always optimized.

== Description ==

The WordPress Database Table Optimizer plugin will automatically make sure that your WordPress MySQL database tables are always optimized.

I've also included an admin page located at Manage > Optimize Database.  This page will allow you to confirm your WordPress MySQL database tables are optimized, show you the number of rows per table, and the size of the table.

== Installation ==

All you need to do is up load the ft_db_optimize folder to your WordPress plugins folder, activate the plugin and it will do the rest.

e.g.

1. Upload the `ft_db_optimize` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Data screen.

== Arbitrary section ==

This plugin uses Aidan Lister size_readable PHP function to show the file sizes of the MySQL tables.  I've changed the name of the function to avoid naming conflicts with other plugins that may be using this function as well.
